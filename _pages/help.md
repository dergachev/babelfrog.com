After you activate it on a given page, BabelFrog will translate all text to
your chosen language. To activate:

* Via keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> on Windows, <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>E</kbd> on a Mac.
* By selecting "Translate with BabelFrog" in the right-click menu.
* By clicking on the BabelFrog icon in Chrome's toolbar:
  <img class="frame" src="/img/babelfrog-chromebar.png">

Now that BabelFrog is active, you can select any word, sentence, or paragraph to translate it.

By default, BabelFrog translates from French to English, so here's some French text for you to practice on.

<div class="amsterdam" style="padding: 3px 10px 3px 80px; font-size: 1.4em; color: #555;">
<p>
Dans le port d'Amsterdam <br/>
Y a des marins qui chantent <br/>
Les rÃªves qui les hantent<br/>
Au large d'Amsterdam<br/>
</p>
<p><em>--Amsterdam, par Jacques Brel</em></p>
</div>

Happy translating!!

### Language Settings

Clicking on the BabelFrog icon a second time will bring up the settings panel, where you can set the languages you'd like to work in.

### Other tips

* To translate the text of a link, hold <kbd>Alt</kbd> while clicking on it.
* Double click on a word to select it. Triple click to select the whole paragraph.
* Keep in mind that BabelFrog is activated only one page at a time. When you navigate to a different page (or even just refresh), BabelFrog is reset, to avoid slowing down your browser by running unnecessarily.
