FAQ
===

### What languages are supported?

BabelFrog allows all [348 languages](https://support.google.com/translate/toolkit/answer/147837?hl=en) supported by Google Translate API!

### How do I customize the keyboard shortcut? 

If the default keyboard shortcut (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on Windows, or <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>B</kbd> on a mac) doesn't work for you, you can change it via a link at the bottom of Chrome's Extensions settings page:

### Does installing BabelFrog pose a security risk or slow down Chrome?

Most other extensions automatically run on EVERY webpage you visit, increasing
page loading time and compromising your data for no good reason. To us, that's
about as absurd as eating frogs!  BabelFrog is careful to only run on the page
YOU activate it. After you refresh or navigate away, it goes back to
hibernation.

### How is BabelFrog free?

While Google recently discontinued free access to the [Google Translate API](https://developers.google.com/translate/v2/faq), Chrome extensions are still able to access the public web service that powers [translate.google.com](https://translate.google.com) website and Google Chrome's built-in translation feature.

### Where can I leave a review for BabelFrog?

If you like BabelFrog, tell the world by writing a review for it on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/babelfrog/jnhmkblbgggfgeebimebebnkhgnagnpj).

### Is it open source?

What self-respecting amphibian wouldn't want to spawn offspring? Visit the
[GitHub repo](https://github.com/dergachev/babelfrog) to access and customize
the source code.

### What if I found a bug?

BabelFrog loves bugs, especially juicy ones with screenshots, URLs, and other
details! Bug reports should go on the [GitHub issue
queue](https://github.com/dergachev/babelfrog/issues).  Pull requests and
feature suggestions are welcome, though keep in mind that we're trying to keep
the functionality minimal. A frog should be just a frog.

### What's up with the name?

BabelFrog evolved from the [Babel fish](http://hitchhikers.wikia.com/wiki/Babel_Fish), and it croaks and has legs.
