BabelFrog Demo
-----------

Helps you learn a new language by translating selected text A Google Chrome extension to help you learn a language as you browse the web. Uses Google Translate to translate the selected text. Unlike other similar extensions, it doesn't slow down your browser or compromise your security by injecting itself into EVERY PAGE YOU visit, instead allowing you to activate it on a page-by-page basis.

To activate BabelFrog, simply open the page you'd like translated, then click on the BabelFrog icon, or press Alt-F on your keyboard. Doing this action a second time will bring up the BabelFrog settings panel, where you can set the languages you'd like to work in. 

After activating BabelFrog on a given page, any selected text will be instantly translated into the language you chose. Because links can be awkward to select without accidentally clicking them, BabelFrog will translate any link you click on while holding down the Alt key.
